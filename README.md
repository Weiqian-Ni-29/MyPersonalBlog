This project is my personal Blog website, the final result can be viewed on https://secure-forest-80430.herokuapp.com/about. 
Fontend was build using html, css, ejs and bootstrap. The backend was build using Node.js and express. I have chosen to use MongoDB Atlas service to store all of my data and have access to it via mangoose. This website is hosted on Heroku.<br>
